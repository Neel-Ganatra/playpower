## 🔄 **How the Mock AI System Works**

### **When Groq API is NOT configured:**
```
GROQ_API_KEY = undefined or invalid
     ↓
Mock AI System Activated
     ↓
Intelligent Mock Responses Generated
     ↓
API Returns Realistic Data
```

### **Mock AI Features Active:**

#### 1️⃣ **Question Generation**
- Creates contextual questions based on:
  - Grade level (1-12)
  - Subject matter
  - Difficulty (easy/medium/hard)
- **Example Response:**
```json
{
  "question": "intermediate Mathematics question 1 for grade 5",
  "options": [
    "Correct answer for Mathematics",
    "Incorrect option A", 
    "Incorrect option B",
    "Incorrect option C"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 0,
  "explanation": "This question tests intermediate understanding of Mathematics concepts for grade 5."
}
```

#### 2️⃣ **Hint System**
- Provides contextual hints based on:
  - User's current answer
  - Number of attempts
  - Question difficulty
- **Example Response:**
```json
{
  "hint": "Think about the basic concepts of Mathematics. Consider the relationship between the given elements.",
  "hintLevel": "basic"
}
```

#### 3️⃣ **Performance Analysis**
- Analyzes quiz results:
  - Calculates scores
  - Identifies weak areas
  - Suggests improvements
- **Example Response:**
```json
{
  "performance": "Good",
  "strengths": ["Problem solving", "Basic concepts"],
  "weaknesses": ["Advanced calculations"],
  "suggestions": ["Practice more complex problems"]
}
```
